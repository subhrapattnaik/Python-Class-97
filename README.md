# Python-Class-97

Python is free and simple to learn

Python supports cross-platform operating systems which makes building applications with it all the more convenient

1.Python can be used to make web-applications 
2.Python is used in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence 
3.Python is used in Data Science and Data Visualization
4.Python is used in Web Scraping Applications: pull a large amount of data from websites which can then be helpful in various real-world processes such as price comparison, job listings, research and development and much more.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
Getting the Data Type
You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

Python Conditions and If statements
Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Indentation
Python relies on indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define scope in the code. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands:
-----------------------------------------------------
while loops
for loops
The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.


The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:


The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:
